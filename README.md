# Venue-Maestro (A Database Management Systems Project)

This is a simple program that maintains the record of venues for events. The front end was created using PyQt and the data is stored in an SQL database.  
Two types of users, customer and owner can log in to this. Customer can book a venue while the owner lists the venue.
